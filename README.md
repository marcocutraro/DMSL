# DMSL
My personal Data Mining and Machine Learning journey using Python and R.

## Ideal Roadmap
- Intro
- Data Visualization
- Parametric and nonparametric models
- Evaluation of the accuracy of a model - Contrasting goodness of fit and complexity of a model
- Regression and Classification:
  - Linear regression
  - Logistic regression
  - Discriminant analysis
  - K-nearest neighbors
- Resampling methods:
  - cross validation
  - Bootstrapping
- Linear model selection and regularization:
  - Stepwise selection
  - Ridge regression
  - Principal components regression
  - Partial least squares
  - LASSO
- Nonlinear methods (flexible regression):
  - Polynomial regression
  - Regression splines
  - Smoothing splines
  - Generalized additive models
- Methods based on decision trees:
  - regression trees and classification
  - Bagging
  - Random forests
  - Boosting
- Support Vector Machines:
  - maximal margin classifier
  - Support Vector type classifier
  - Classification with margins of nonlinear decision
  - SVM with more than two classes
- Unsupervised Learning:
  - Association rules
  - PCA
  - Grouping methods
