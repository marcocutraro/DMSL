## Introduction to Statistical Learning

#### Supervised vs Unsupervised Statistical Learning

Supervised Statistical Learning involves building a statistical model for predicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs. Problems of this nature occur in fields as diverse as business, medicine, astrophysics, and public policy.

With Unsupervised Statistical Learning, there are inputs but no supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and structure from such data.

#### Supervised Learning

- Itâ€™s a Machine/Statistical Learning approach that uses labeled data sets for training
- The input data used for training is paired with corresponding output labels.
- It aims to find a relationship between:
  - the input variables X = (X1, X2, . . . , Xp) (aka regressors, predictor random variables, features, covariates, indipendent variables);
  - the desired outcome Y (aka dependent variables, response, target).
- It can be divided into two main types:
  - Regression: Y is quantitative;
  - Classification: Y is qualitative.
- The algorithm iteratively modifies its parameters to minimize the discrepancy between its predicted output and the actual output.

#### Unsupervised Learning

- It uses Machine Learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets.
- No outcome variable, just a set of p features (X1, X2, . . . , Xp) measured on a set of samples.
- These algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention.
- Unsupervised Learning models are used for three main tasks:
  - Clustering: Grouping unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences;
  - Association: Discovering interesting relationships among variables;
  - Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of random variables to consider.
